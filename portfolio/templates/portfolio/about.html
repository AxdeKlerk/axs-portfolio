        <p>Hi! My name is Ax. I'm a former chef turned full stack developer — a shift that began as a small spark of curiosity and soon became a full-blown creative pursuit. What started as late nights and very early mornings learning to code has evolved into a new rhythm of life, one where structure and imagination meet in every project I take on.</p>
        <p>Today, my focus is on crafting purposeful, user-centred applications — clean in code, intentional in design, and grounded in the same passion that’s shaped every chapter of my journey so far.</p>

        <h2>From Kitchen to Code</h2>
        <p>Years in professional kitchens taught me more than recipes and heat — they taught me the art of precision, consistency, flow, and creating something visually captivating yet functionally reliable and technically sound.</p>
        <p>I bring that same discipline to development: clear planning, methodical thinking, and an obsession with refining the process until everything works just right. Whether it’s <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Bootstrap</em>, <em>Python</em> or <em>Django</em>, I approach each tool like an ingredient, knowing it’s the balance between them that makes something truly outstanding.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Learning Never Stops</h2>
        <p>After completing my Level 5 Full Stack Development course with the Code Institute, it took me less than a week to feel that familiar itch — the one that says, “you’re not done yet.” So, I took advantage of a discount offer and dove straight into a Codecademy subscription to keep building on that momentum to continue to learn. I have always loved learning — it’s something that feels less like an obligation to stay informed and more like a personal drive to grow and explore new ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Before the Code</h2>
        <p>Before tech, my path led through Criminology and Criminal Justice Policy, earning a First-Class degree and postgraduate study at the London School of Economics and Political Science. That experience honed my analytical mindset and love for detail, which now drive how I debug, test, and design.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
        <p>Outside of code, I’m still very much the same creative at heart — a proud metalhead who finds calm in structure, fuel in caffeine, and inspiration in everyday rhythm. I’m at my happiest standing in a field, beer in hand, watching live music surrounded by people who share that same pulse of passion — laughing, shouting lyrics, and soaking up the energy that only a live crowd can bring.</p>
        <p>That same rush I feel in front of a live stage often mirrors the flow I chase while coding — both driven by rhythm, emotion, and a desire to make something that moves people. My mornings start with Barry, my loyal sidekick, before settling into projects that blend logic with artistry — from building functional web apps to experimenting with design in Figma.</p>
